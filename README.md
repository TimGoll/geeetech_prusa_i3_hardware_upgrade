# z-axis rotary bearing holder
To further improve the sound level, two bearing were added.

## Still to do
- [ ] enlarge the hole diameter to 7mm such that the screw heads fit in with ease
- [ ] the motobreacked screwholes must be spaced 31mm
- [ ] the end stop switch must be a bit thinner to ensure a perfect fit with the x-axis rods
- [ ] enlarge the drill holes
- [ ] change the mounting methode of the two parts of the left axis sled; it should be without nuts
